# WODRight

Now open source!

At some point I accidentally nuked my `.git` folder.  Oops.  

## Installation instructions

Run `npm install` then you can do `gulp install`.

Once everything is installed, you can run in "dev" mode by opening one terminal and running `gulp watch`, and in another run `ionic serve --lab`.

This will open your browser with side-by-side views representative of iOS and Android.
