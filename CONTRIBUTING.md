# Contribute to WODRight

This guide details how to use issues and pull requests to improve WODRight

See: [GitHub's Guide to Contributing to Open Source](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/)

Please stick as close as possible to the guidelines. That way we ensure quality guides
and easy to merge requests.

Your Pull Request will be reviewed by one of our devs/volunteers and you will be
asked to reformat it if needed. We don't bite and we will try to be as flexible
as possible, so don't get intimidated by the extent of the guidelines :)

To make everything easier, please keep Pull Requests small.  Don't refactor our entire codebase to add a change in color of a menu.

For better maintainance and clarity, some naming guidelines should be followed.
See details in each section below.

## Issues

If a GitHub Issue doesn't exist for what you're working on, please make one and reference it in your Pull Request.
It can even be done after-the-fact, we just want an easy to reference-later issue.

## Pull Request title

Try to be as more descriptive as you can in your Pull Request title.

Particularly if you are submitting a new menu or feature... include it in the title, and mention the issue it implements/fixes.

For example some good titles would be:

* [Feature] New calculator for water intake per #1
* [Bug Fix] Missing several exclamation points !! per #2
