                    WODRightâ„¢ is a percentage calculator for estimating barbell weights for circuit training, Crossfit, and high intensity interval training with barbells. It does this by using your specific maximum effort strength limitations and provides a safe range of weights for related movements based on volume and experience level.

                            When in doubt, round down. It is always a good idea to go lighter than heavier when using barbells for high-intensity circuit training

                            Total reps means the total number of repetitions you will complete in the workout for that one movement. To find this, multiply the number of rounds you plan to complete by the number of repetitions in each round, or add all the repetitions you will complete in a given workout.

                            If doing multiple movements with a single bar, use the recommended weight for the weakest movement i.e., If you are doing 30 clean and jerks, for time, and the calculator says to clean 200 but jerk 150, only load 150 on the bar.

                            Be honest in entering your maxes. If you think you could have squatted 300lbs for 3 reps but only did 2, enter 300lbs for 2 reps in the max calculator
